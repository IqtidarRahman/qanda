The threads part of the page is designed to be as compact as possible meaning that anywhere clicked usually leads to something happening. The thread preview side panel has maximum coverage to ensure the whole bar leads to clicking a thread, and opening it up on the main bar.

Other features incorporated included using clearly labelled and readable buttons.

The top bar containing all the interaction elements of each thread is well in view of the fold. This allows for easy access to all interactive features available.

The 'create post' button has been enlarged as this would be the main function of the website. As a result it is drawn as a focal point at the top of the page and in the fold.

The more feature allows for optimal scrolling.
